# Notes
The code is a hack-job from 2009 when I was a Python noob (I'm still a noob, but
less so now). The following are some ideas for how the code could be improved.
I may never get around to this as I have little time and no real motivation.

First things first, it should be rewritten in Python 3.

The themeElements data structure should be moved to an external,
user-configurable JSON file so that it can be updated independently. It's
practically in JSON format already and it would be trivial to export it.

FUSE is likely overkill. I don't even remember right how much it handles, but
it would be worth investigating FIFOs as replacements.

All of the has_key and other noobish tests should be replaced with proper
try/except blocks. There's probably a load of other conventions that need to be
changed.
